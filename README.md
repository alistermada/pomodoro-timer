# Pomodoro Timer

A timer based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), which allows users to set an interval (pomodoro) for work, separated by breaks. Each pomodoro is followed by a short break except for every fourth pomodoro, which is followed by a long break.
